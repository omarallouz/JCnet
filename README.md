# JCnet

This is a deep learning workflow for Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy lesion and brain segmentation from brain MRI using Python 3, Keras, and TensorFlow. The model generates segmentation masks of the brain parenchyma and lesions in PML patients.

The basic code structure was adopted from the following [source](https://www.nitrc.org/projects/flexconn/) with several notable changes. We have created two tailored scripts for brain parechymal extraction and lesion segmentation training. We have also introduced improvements in training/validation split which is now undertaken at the atlas level to remove patch sampling overlap effects, included support for Tensorboard logging, and generation of training/validation accuracy and loss automatically at the end of training. In addition, the method now offers support for 3 different trainable network acrchitechures:
1. [3D Unet](https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.06650)
2. [Feature pyramid network-ResNet50 (with bottleneck ResNet modules)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.03144)
3. [Panoptic feature pyramid network-ResNet50 (with preactivated ResNet modules)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.02446)
